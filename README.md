Groovy M2X API Client
========================

The AT&T M2X API provides all the needed operations to connect your device to AT&T's [M2X](http://m2x.att.com) service. 
This client provides an easy to use interface for [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org).


Getting Started
==========================
1. Signup for an [M2X Account](https://m2x.att.com/signup).
2. Obtain your _Master Key_ from the Master Keys tab of your [Account Settings](https://m2x.att.com/account) screen.
2. Create your first [Data Source Blueprint](https://m2x.att.com/blueprints) and copy its _Feed ID_.
3. Review the [M2X API Documentation](https://m2x.att.com/developer/documentation/overview).


Leveraging Java library
=======================

Instead of providing a M2X library for Groovy, we decided to take advantage of the existing [Java client library](https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-java) since Groovy can call Java code freely. As a result, this library here only contains Groovy examples on connecting to M2X using the Java client library.

There're 2 ways to run the examples: if you are using [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), you can launch the script right in the IDE; otherwise, you can still run the examples under command line. In either case, [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) must also be installed. We will explain how to run the examples in both ways below.

For more details on using the M2X Java client, please refer to its [README file](https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-java/blob/master/README.md).

How to Run Examples in IntelliJ IDEA
====================================

1. Clone [m2x-java](https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-java) library

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-java
```

2. Build the Java library and install it to local Maven repository

```
   $ cd m2x-java
   $ mvn package install
```

3. Clone [m2x-groovy](https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-groovy) example library

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-groovy
```

4. Launch IntelliJ, open the m2x-groovy project.

5. Right click on `pom.xml` file, select `Maven`, `Reimport`.

6. Now you can select the Groovy script file in the project, right click it and select `Run`. However, you might want to change the source to use the correct key, etc first.

How to Run Examples in Command Line
===================================

1. Clone [m2x-java](https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-java) library

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-java
```

2. Build the Java client library as one jar file without external dependency

```
   $ cd m2x-java
   $ mvn package -P one-jar
```

3. There will be a file named like `m2x-java-client-0.2-SNAPSHOT-one-jar.jar`(notice the `one-jar` suffix of the filename) in the `target` folder under current path. Keep the full path to this jar file aside for future use

3. Clone [m2x-groovy](https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-groovy) example library

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-groovy
```

4. Use the following command to launch the Groovy script:

```
   $ cd m2x-groovy
   $ groovy -cp <path to the generated jar file> src/main/groovy/com/att/m2x/client/examples/push_data.groovy
```

   Remember to fill in the jar file path obtained in Step 3, you might also want to tweak the script first to fill in the correct key, feed ID, stream name, etc.
